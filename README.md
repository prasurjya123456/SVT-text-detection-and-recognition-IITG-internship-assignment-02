# SVT-text-detection-and-recognition-IITG-internship-assignment-02
This project is a part of the assignments given by IIT Guwahati during summer internship, 2025.

Problem-statement: Create a Python-based program that detects and recognizes text in natural scene images (e.g., street signs, store names, product labels). The program should output the image with bounding boxes around detected text regions and a separate file with the recognized text content. Datasets: SVT-style.
